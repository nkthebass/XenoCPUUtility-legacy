# XenoCPUUtility-legacy
Hello! I am proud to announce that I have made a (hopefully) retro hardware compatible version of XenoCPUUtility! It is in development but should run on windows xp and newer windows OS.

The features it includes: 
1. single core FP benchmark
2. multi core FP benchmark
3. Configurable PI time based benchmark
4. heavy load stress test (utilizes all possible cores)
5. overclock stability benchark also uses all possible cores

It is bases on .NET 4 for the UI and the backend is in C++ 

System requirments:
CPU: Pentium III / Athlon XP or newer
Ram: 256-512mb 
GPU: any supported by windows XP or newer
Storage: 64KB 
OS: windows XP or newer
This already supports newer architectures but I am 90% sure it should work with these if now contact me at nkthebass@gmail.com

  1. Intel Architectures (1998–2012)
P6 Microarchitecture (1995–2001): Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium III Xeon, Celeron (Coppermine/Tualatin).
NetBurst Architecture (2000–2006): Pentium 4 (Willamette, Northwood, Prescott), Pentium D (Dual Core), Xeon (NetBurst).
Pentium M Architecture (2003–2006): Banias, Dothan (Crucial for mobile XP benchmarks).

  3. Key Legacy/Alternative Architectures (1998–2005)
VIA C3 / Cyrix III (1999–2001): Derived from Centaur Technology (Socket 370).
VIA C7 / Eden (2005): Ultra-low power, low-performance chips.
PowerPC (Apple): While Mac-based, the G3 (1997), G4 (1999), and G5 (2003) were relevant in the 98-05 era.
